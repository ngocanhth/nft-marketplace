# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# npx create-next-app@latest --ts

# yarn add hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle @openzeppelin/contracts axios chai ethereum-waffle ethers ipfs-http-client web3modal

# yarn add autoprefixer tailwindcss postcss --dev

# npx hardhat => create base project with hardhat

# Run a hardhar local node: npx hardhat node

# Compile contract: npx hardhat compile
